This is a proof of concept program to show that deployment of services that
use weak two factor authentication system are vulnerable to theft of services.
Here theft of internet services is shown where no prior knowledge of the
Username or Password is required and by just spoofing the second factor or the
authentication i.e MAC of the network interface card and attacker can take over
an already established connection, this program further extends its functionality
and block the communication of the victims machine with the gateway so that he
doesn't log out of the service,this lets us continue to access the Internet service
with out any interruption.

I have tested this program against the Siftbb client and 24-online login client.

This program is being distributed only for educational purpose.
